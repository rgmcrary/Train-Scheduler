## Train Scheduler

This train schedule application incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
This app to calculates when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.

Only users who log into the site with their Google or GitHub accounts can use this site.
